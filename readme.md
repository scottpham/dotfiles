Run this python script and a number of dotfiles will be copied to the local directory in a folder with the name of your computer.

I use this as a reference to make sense of the settings on my work computer and home computer. I use both for work, but I don't necessarily want the same exact dotfiles on each machine. So I keep the settings mostly the same andback them up in one folder on my dropbox.
